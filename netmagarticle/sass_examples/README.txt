This is a Compass Project that you can use to play with Sass and Compass.

Sass and Compass require Ruby. To make sure you have ruby on your system
run the following command on your command line:

    ruby -v

You should see something like:

    ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [universal-darwin10.0]

Sass and Compass will run on ruby 1.8.6 and above.

To install Sass, from your command line type (windows users don't need to type sudo):

    sudo gem install sass

To install Compass:

    sudo gem install compass

To compile this project go to the folder containing this README.

    cd path/to/sass_examples

Then type:

    compass compile
